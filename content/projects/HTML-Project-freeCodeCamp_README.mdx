# "HTML Project for Beginners"

**Directions Followed:**

- There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder.
  Use them as references for what you build.

- You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

- There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link
  that file to your HTML files.

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If you need to find taco emojis, try
  [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/).

- A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of
  each page.
