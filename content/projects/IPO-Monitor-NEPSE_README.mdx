## NEPSE IPO Price Monitor

This is a program that uses Python BeautifulSoup to fetch data from
[MeroLagani](https://merolagani.com) and on the basis of the percentage change,
it alerts the user.

If it has a -ve percent change then only an alert message is generated. It uses
Discord Webhook and Desktop Notification for the alerts.

NOTE: The program is only applicable for IPO's. Because once the price starts
decreasing it takes a very long time to reach the all-time high.

## Features

- Desktop Notifications
- Discord Webhook
- Cross-platform
- Real-Time data

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to
your .env file

`WEB_HOOK_URL`

## Usage

```

**MAKE SURE TO CREATE A DISCORD WEBHOOK BEFORE USE TO NEVER MISS OUT
